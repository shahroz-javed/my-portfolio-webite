from-blue-600 → from-[your-color]
to-purple-600 → to-[your-color]
```

### Adjusting Animations
Edit durations in `animations.css`:
```css
.animate-fade-in-up {
  animation: fadeInUp 0.8s ease-out forwards; /* Change 0.6s to 0.8s */
}
```

### Mobile Optimization
Components use Tailwind responsive:
- `md:` - tablets (768px+)
- `lg:` - desktops (1024px+)
- Mobile-first by default
